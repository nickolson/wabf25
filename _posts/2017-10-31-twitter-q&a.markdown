As we approach the 25th annual Wharton Africa Business Forum, the WABF team is honored to be joined by Professor Calestous Juma of Harvard University for a live, interactive Twitter Q&A event at 1:30pm Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 1st!

The theme of WABF this year is "Continental Conversations: Choices for a New Africa." In his celebrated career, Professor Juma has written extensively about key choices for Africa and his native Kenya in the fields of science, technology, and development. He has explored these topics in numerous journal articles and in books such as The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa (Oxford University Press, 2015) and Innovation and its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies (Oxford University Press, 2016). He is also working on an upcoming book on regional economic integration in Africa.

In this session, participants will be able to ask Professor Juma questions on choices for Africa relating to his fields of study by using the hashtag #JumaWABF at his Twitter account of [@calestous](https://twitter.com/calestous). Participants may also email Steve Rizoli, Professor Juma's student and a WABF organizer, to send questions in advance of the session will bed addressed at the beginning of the interactive event [steven_rizoli@student.hks.harvard.edu](mailto:steven_rizoli@student.hks.harvard.edu).

Tickets are still available for the historic 25th WABF conference (November 3rd to 5th in Philadelphia) at [wabf2017.whartonafrica.com](wabf2017.whartonafrica.com). We hope to see you there!
